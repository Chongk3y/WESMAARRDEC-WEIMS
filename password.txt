under secretariat:
db_table = "Consortium_secretariat"
originall was named secretariat but cmi_models.models is also using secretariat as a dbtable name which is a duplicate

under commodity
changes
db_tables:
icematerial=>consortium_iecmaterial
commodity ==> consortium_commodity
fk changes:
	from:
		cmi_name = models.ForeignKey(CMI, related_name="commodities",verbose_name = "CMI", on_delete=models.CASCADE) 
	to:
		cmi_name = models.ForeignKey(CMI, related_name="consortium_commodities",verbose_name = "CMI", on_delete=models.CASCADE) 
message:
	It again messes with the cmi_models.model.py because reasons.

Under team:
similar to fk changes above and db_tables :
	team ==> consortium_team

under program: 
changed model related name: (conflicting with again CMI_models)
